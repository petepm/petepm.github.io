This tune sort of feels like the sequel to
["Death Country"](transitional-farms/death-country),
but less hopeful.
See, back in 2007 or so, I thought politics in the US was as insane as it could
possibly get, ya know, with Sarah Palin being floated as a VP pick.
Little did I know how much worse things could get.
