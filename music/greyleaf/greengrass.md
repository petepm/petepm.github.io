This tune sort of feels like the sequel to
["Death Country"](transitional-farms/death-country),
but less hopeful.
See, back in 2007 or so, I thought politics in the US was as insane as it could
possibly get, ya know, with Sarah Palin being floated as a VP pick.
Little did I know how much worse things could get.

There are four Pantera-inspired Easter egg riffs in here.
Can you find them all?

## Lyrics

>And a-one
>And a-too many motherfuckers still haven't uncovered
>What it means to be true to say
>Yeah just playin'
>Sittin' in their room and spittin' on another human all day
>
>Guy may be your brother but you gotta hate each other
>That guy it ain't me
>See thee speech be free
>Thank you Satan for this blessed technology
>
>Day of judgement
>What's the nudge sent
>No brain so blame on the gubmint royalty
>Tee up and take a swing little buddy
>
>Are the ravens still circling that mountain top?
>
>Now it's been one hundred years
>Got to wake our sleeping king
>Beard wrapped three times round that post
>He's gonna come fix everything
>If he's feeling reticent
>We'll just have to make him see
>
>Long time small town maybe
>Sebastian by our kingdom come
>Big time big crime baby
>Millennarian legend rerun
>Yeah we're going way down down down down
>
>Go summon up that little man
>Sword and shield kept on display
>Bow to your master peasant boys
>What a gift to see this day
>Day-by-day impostors will pay
>
>Now don't take your medicine
>Doctor's cursed by the demons
>Yeah you know that they've been schemin'
>To steal our green and
>Turn that grass gray
>Feminine skeletons
>
>Never gonna last indeterminate man
>Better run past it as fast as you can
>Gotta have gold if you want in the van
>Charlatan
>
>Hundred thousand years just a flash in the pan
>Hourglass tipped and it's low on the sand
>I got a little red pill from your mom's brother Sam
>And it ain't at all a part of the plan
>Bam
>
>It's the end now
>A false flat back then
>Got to get back into the mountain
>Go back to sleep
>It is not the day
>Sun will not begin to shine no way
