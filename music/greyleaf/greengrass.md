This tune sort of feels like the sequel to
["Death Country"](transitional-farms/death-country),
but less hopeful.
See, back in 2007 or so, I thought politics in the US was as insane as it could
possibly get, ya know, with Sarah Palin being floated as a VP pick.
Little did I know how much worse things could get.

There are four Pantera-inspired Easter egg riffs in here.
Can you find them all?

## Lyrics

>And a-one<br>
>And a-too many motherfuckers still haven't uncovered<br>
>What it means to be true to say<br>
>Yeah just playin'<br>
>Sittin' in their room and spittin' on another human all day
>
>Guy may be your brother but you gotta hate each other<br>
>That guy it ain't me<br>
>See thee speech be free<br>
>Thank you Satan for this blessed technology
>
>Day of judgement<br>
>What's the nudge sent<br>
>No brain so blame on the gubmint royalty<br>
>Tee up and take a swing little buddy
>
>Are the ravens still circling that mountain top?
>
>Now it's been one hundred years<br>
>Got to wake our sleeping king<br>
>Beard wrapped three times round that post<br>
>He's gonna come fix everything<br>
>If he's feeling reticent<br>
>We'll just have to make him see
>
>Long time small town maybe<br>
>Sebastian by our kingdom come<br>
>Big time big crime baby<br>
>Millennarian legend rerun<br>
>Yeah we're going way down down down down
>
>Go summon up that little man<br>
>Sword and shield kept on display<br>
>Bow to your master peasant boys<br>
>What a gift to see this day<br>
>Day-by-day impostors will pay
>
>Now don't take your medicine<br>
>Doctor's cursed by the demons<br>
>Yeah you know that they've been schemin'<br>
>To steal our green and<br>
>Turn that grass gray<br>
>Feminine skeletons
>
>Never gonna last indeterminate man<br>
>Better run past it as fast as you can<br>
>Gotta have gold if you want in the van<br>
>Charlatan
>
>Hundred thousand years just a flash in the pan<br>
>Hourglass tipped and it's low on the sand<br>
>I got a little red pill from your mom's brother Sam<br>
>And it ain't at all a part of the plan<br>
>Bam
>
>It's the end now<br>
>A false flat back then<br>
>Got to get back into the mountain<br>
>Go back to sleep<br>
>It is not the day<br>
>Sun will not begin to shine no way
