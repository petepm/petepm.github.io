Social media was supposed to be a way for us to make connection to follow up
on IRL,
but it turned into a replacement,
and a way to spread stupid and wrong ideas.
If I were smart, I'd quit
[like Carl King](https://carlkingdom.com/carl-king-is-no-longer-on-social-media).

This song, whose genre I would describe as "tech grunge," is about that.

## Lyrics

>The game that beats us down<br>
>A source of entertainment<br>
>The game that breaks us up<br>
>Attaching to engagement<br>
>Delete me please
>
>Weighed so low<br>
>I'm drowned in everything<br>
>Cheap screens brought in the score
>
>Can't look at what reflects<br>
>Afraid of what I'll see<br>
>The dark side of me
>
>Weighed so<br>
>Soul burnt I know<br>
>Still we plead<br>
>Bleeding goals<br>
>Further I go<br>
>Through the needs<br>
>A like suicide<br>
>Back to feed
>
>Counting on the careless<br>
>Envying the free<br>
>Cashing out awareness<br>
>Back to square one
>
>Games beyond the game<br>
>The force of entertainment<br>
>I'm not a bug<br>
>This is not a song<br>
>Conceived in panic<br>
>Produced without no<br>
>Attempt to feel good<br>
>Weakening<br>
>Self worth must be determined again<br>
>Escape the main symbol<br>
>Caught in net
>
>Waste your life in the<br>
>Race, humanity<br>
>Insincerely
