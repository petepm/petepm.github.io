Following what seems to be a disturbing pattern, "Eigenvalue", the second track
from [_Synchronized Seasoning_](/music/synchronized-seasoning) took way too long
to finish. In fact, I'm now almost 30 years old, and this song was mostly
written more than half a decade ago. The time between was filled with some tough
stuff and some negative thoughts, but I kept chipping away at this beast slowly
in the background. During this period I was in grad school, which is notorious
for causing self-doubt, and worse. Thus, this one is a bit dark.

My old pal [Travis Orbin](http://travisorbin.com) is on the drums for this one
(check out his [session video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0f2TP-Lugk)!),
and I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone else in the universe that could
have done as good a job. The drums were recorded at [Anup
Sastry](https://www.facebook.com/AnupSastryMusic/)'s studio. Apparently, beyond
being a great drummer, Anup possesses some impressive audio engineering chops.
The drums were recorded in the Winter of 2012--2013 (I actually had to search my
email to find the dates); yes, it took three years to record this sucker, and
even longer before that to write it, record some draft guitars, program some
drums, etc. You'd think after working on it for so long, the song would be
pretty damn great, but we won't talk about that.

I happened to have filmed some silly footage along the way to put together a
for the song (see above). If you look closely, you can
probably notice age differences between the various clips, complete with
gray/less hair. This tune is also available as a free download from
[bandcamp](https://petepeterson.bandcamp.com/album/synchronized-seasoning).


## Gear

The gear used to record this song is listed below. As you'll note, I changed
DAWs partway through, from Cubase to Reaper. I was tired of the Cubase licenser
dongle, Reaper is much less expensive for a pleb like me, and it saves project
files as plain text. Saving plain text has the advantage of being amenable to
version control---namely [Git](https://git-scm.com), which allows one to make
"checkpoints" along the way, and to go back to these if an unwanted change is
made to the project. Furthermore, one can create "branches" to nondestructively
try out new ideas and only "merge" these if they work out. Keeping project files
in Git may also open up avenues for online collaboration via
[GitHub](https://github.com), though storing large amount of audio files could
get unwieldy.

* Guitar: Agile Sentinel 725 with Lollar Blonde (neck) and Special (bridge) pickups
* Classical guitar: Some cheap 7-string classical
* Amp: Mostly Peavey Revalver Mk III.V with Poulin Rectifier and Peavey 6505+ modeling VSTs, sent into RedWirez Mesa Recto cab/SM-57 impulses
* Microphone: SM-7b
* DAW: Cubase 6, 6.5, 8, then Reaper
* Voice: My very own human voice
* Drums: Whatever the hell Travis was using---check out his video


## Lyrics

>Down in hell<br>
>Did this to your own self<br>
>Missed the call<br>
>And fucking wasted it all<br>
>Got no friends, no wealth
>
>Sold soul<br>
>Couldn't accept your role
>
>Bound to die<br>
>Trapped on no one's side<br>
>Wanna be best but who you tryin' to impress<br>
>And if you only fear this<br>
>You'll not be peerless<br>
>Follow your<br>
>Dreams killed quickly as they're born
>
>Wait, no<br>
>Glorious life postponed
>
>I see<br>
>What you fucking did there<br>
>I played
>
>Comfort is a lie to you we'll say<br>
>Things are getting better every day<br>
>Can't lose if you don't play
>
>Shame<br>
>No other fucked up<br>
>What will people think?<br>
>Dilettante<br>
>What you get ain't gonna be what you want
>
>Sit back and pass on every opportunity<br>
>No golden chance for me<br>
>Things just ain't right right now<br>
>I've got to let 'em go<br>
>No golden chance I know
>
>I see<br>
>You'll bleed
>
>Steepening climb<br>
>Destined to fall<br>
>Median after all<br>
>This zero sum is not a game<br>
>I'm played
>
>Normal pain<br>
>Emotion comes too late
>
>Nails, on chalkboard<br>
>It's a keyword<br>
>That G-word<br>
>No applause<br>
>Thus, no cause
>
>Shrinking eigenvalue now<br>
>Never tested<br>
>Now I can't grow<br>
>Not in those who know<br>
>Waiting for it<br>
>Entitled to instant success<br>
>Fuck this fucking shit
>
>I sit and watch as an old man that I've become<br>
>My paths reduced to none<br>
>It's all been a waste
>
>I sat alone and slighted opportunity<br>
>This golden chance for me<br>
>It never was there<br>
>I should have seen the cliff this path was leadin' to<br>
>This golden chance I blew
>
>Owwwwwwww<br>
>No other fucked up<br>
>What will people say?<br>
>Impostor
