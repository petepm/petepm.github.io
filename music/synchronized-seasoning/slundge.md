8 months for ["Exclusive Orangery"](exclusive-orangery);
7 for ["Singleton"](singleton);
10 for "Slundge".
We haven't brought the lead time down, but this is a long one, so we'll give
ourselves a break.

I believe this tune roughly started with the thought experiment of
WWJD (what would Jimi [Hendrix] do) with a 7 string and modern guitar tones,
hence the liberal use of double stops throughout.
Add in a little bit of alt-rock, grunge, br00tz, and fluid mechanics and
you get---something.

The [Orbmeister](http://travisorbin.com) served his critical role on the drumset
and engineering the drum recording.
As you might expect, and is detailed below, there were some difficult parts.
Obviously you must watch his
[session video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDAJBfFbBPE).

Though it will be tweaked a little for the album release,
this tune is now available on
[bandcamp](https://petepeterson.bandcamp.com/track/slundge-the-collective),
Google Play Music, iTunes, Spotify, Apple Music, etc.


## Composition notes

There was a little "computational composition" involved to generate some of the
synth parts.
Because the lyrics draw analogies with continuum mechanics, it made
some sense to use a
[random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk),
often used to model discrete particles (the opposite of a continuum) as a musical concept.
It didn't come out particularly tonal sounding, but it adds another layer of
information and serves as a first dip of the toes into a pool that could be worth a deep dive.
The process of writing the code to generate the MIDI is shown here:

Following from the principle of harmony being the superposition of waveforms,
I composed a drum part for the guitar solo-ish section with a few longer
timescale patterns of various frequencies.
However, rather than turning the frequencies into periods of repeating patterns
of notes like with [Translational Frames](translational-frames),
the frequencies are used to modulate
the periods between notes within the repeating patterns.
This was somewhat inspired by a Mattias IA Eklundh video I saw on YouTube.
He has a tune with a part that "compresses," or gets faster over time.
The difference here is that there is both compression and rarefaction,
and these all happen with different periods.

It "breathes" a bit, but at different wavelengths on different drums.
Sort of like the Orbitz in Bugz, except rather than keeping the periods
constant but in specified ratios, they change with their own periods.

What are these periods you ask?

We have a cycle of 4-3-2-1-0-1-2-3... in the snare and ride, which sums to 16.

We have a cycle of 4-5-6-5... in the kick that lasts the sum of those (20).

20/16 is 5/4, which is the same as a major 3rd interval in just intonation.
Does this matter? No.

Then with the cymbals, we have 9-10 repeating over and over again, which lasts
19 notes each cycle, of course. Maybe this should be considered rhythmically
dissonant, but it's not heard like that anyway. Does this matter? Again, no.

See the diagram below for a visual explanation.

Of course muscle memory doesn't really work at these long timescales so Travis
basically had to... I have no idea how he did it.
Let him explain the struggle:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tracked some <a href="https://twitter.com/petepm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@petepm</a> songs last night. In one of them there’s a MASSIVE, expansive polymeter. The kick cycles single hits in 2-4/5-8/3-4/5-8 (repeat), the snare plays a pattern of two 8ths then 4 quarters /3/2/1/0/1/2/3 (repeat), then the crashes trade off (left, right) in cycles</p>&mdash; Travis Orbin (@travisorbin) <a href="https://twitter.com/travisorbin/status/1241663573132226565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 22, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Oh, and he was able to apply the manual fade-in or crescendo,
for which he initially set my expectations low, hinting I'd probably need to
automate it. But nope, he did it.
Travis keeps pushing the limits of human drumming skill and
I continue to be grateful for his willingness to put in massive effort towards
my sometimes unreasonable musical aspirations.

## Lyrics

>Continuum<br>
No trace where it started from<br>
All in one<br>
Seeks to be discrete though<br>
We're all caught in the flow<br>
Dread to be a domestique<br>
>
>Fall down the cascade<br>
Hierarchically afraid<br>
Streamlines<br>
Don't mind<br>
Try to control<br>
One's role<br>
Can't see heaven with perfect soul<br>
Spokes pull different ways but still the wheel rolls<br>
>
>Cries stowed<br>
Whispering inside a tornado<br>
>
>Blown to pieces by the wind<br>
Dissipated all within<br>
I'm waiting for rain<br>
To escape<br>
Entrain me<br>
>
>Continuum<br>
Didn't even talk to 'em<br>
Seem to walk randomly<br>
The patterns could they be math<br>
Not a free path<br>
Feel bad for acting kind of mean<br>
>
>Up down left right over the background show<br>
Perturbations grow<br>
Disparate rarefied<br>
But yeah we're bound to move together<br>
To glean clues<br>
From obscene views<br>
>
>To infinitely shear<br>
We can't all steer<br>
Row row... row<br>
>
>Die slow<br>
Whispering inside some things to know<br>
>
>Blown to pieces by the wind<br>
Dissipated all within<br>
I'm fucking on TV<br>
Fucking those who fucked with me<br>
>
>Should be lifting like a wing<br>
Not dragging hating everything<br>
I'm waiting for rain<br>
To escape<br>
Entrain me<br>
>
>OWWWWWWW<br>
OOOOHHHH<br>
HEEEEAVE<br>
HOOOOOOO<br>
>
>Sum villains and heroes<br>
Balance momentum so below<br>
>
>Tides grow<br>
Whispering to those above chapeau<br>
>
>Lay low<br>
Feel the pressure say which way to go
