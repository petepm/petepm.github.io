As the penultimate tune on [_Synchronized Seasoning_](/music/synchronized-seasoning),
but also the shortest, I wanted this one to be exciting with some attitude.
Hopefully it actually turned out that way, but how am I supposed to know?

[Travis Orbin](http://travisorbin.com) drummed on this tune as one might expect,
and I requested he throw in a little drum solo, which ended up kicking ass,
as you can tell from my subtle (?) commentary throughout.

## Composition notes

### Main chuggity chugs

The intro of the tune (after the chromatic-ish pre-intro)
has this kind of chicken-picked hammered-on sort of lick,
which was the first little idea that popped up years and years ago.
I assumed I'd do some sort of heavy palm muting thing with the guitar's lowest power chord over
it, but left writing that until much later (I think 2020 or so).

So I had to come up with some sort of pattern. I'm not sure how I landed on it

    2-1-1-2-2-1-1-4

but after programming it into the scratch drums it seemed to work.


### Chicken lickin' outro

For the outro, I had also come up with a chicken-or-hybrid picked groups of
two string, four note arpeggios that seemed kind of cool, but lacked a rhythmic
pattern to fit them into. I decided that since I was always punishing Travis with
silly polymeter parts, this time I would instead punish myself and distribute
those arpeggios oddly throughout some other pattern.

In comes the original chuggity chug pattern to the rescue--this time slower.
I kept that low power chord pattern part as the backbone,
using a kind of generic "Djent" aesthetic,
but mixed the arpeggios in between.
I ended up having to record the arpeggio chunks one bit at a time, slice them up
in Reaper, and intersperse them between the chugs because my brain could not
work the pattern out otherwise.

But, I wasn't satisfied with the part being performed this way, even though
it sounded pretty cool, so I decided I had to learn how to play it using
hybrid picking.
In this case memory was fine, i.e., I just kept playing it until I could do it
by feel. My brain couldn't try to keep track of which chug group in the pattern
I was on at any give time.

What is this sort of thing called? It's not really a polymeter or polyrhythm.
It's sort of like a multi-riff--two riffs with non-uniform length segments
woven together.

The "melodic" part is sort of 6 segments then 3 segments.
Each is 1/4 long? And the last is 1/2?

The rhythmic part is 30 x 1/8 notes long?

But the lengths really don't matter. It's the number of sections, and it's the
fact that they aren't all the same length that makes it sound weird
(along with the fact the total number is different.)

So where a polymeter drum part sounds strange because the two drums intersect at
different points in the cycle, it's similar here maybe.

The rhythmic part is like the "meter" or measure of time, but it's nonuniform.
You keep moving through the melodic part one rhythmic unit at a time.
The fact there are a different number of rhythmic units (8) versus melodic
units (9) give it a strange feel.

But yeah, it's really the nonuniform sampling that does it. It's maybe like a
nonuniform time signature?
