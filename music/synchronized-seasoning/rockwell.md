As the penultimate tune on [_Synchronized Seasoning_](/music/synchronized-seasoning),
but also the shortest, I really wanted this one to be exciting.
Hopefully it actually is.

[Travis Orbin](http://travisorbin.com) drummed on this tune as one might expect,
and I requested he throw in a little drum solo, which ended up kicking ass.

## Composition notes

2-1-1-2-2-1-1-4

Can also apply to the descending chicken-picked part.

For the outro, I decided that since I was always punishing Travis with
silly polymeter parts, this time I would instead punish myself.

I kept the chuggity chug part as the backbone, but had this melody related to
other parts in the song that I wanted to mix in.
I ended up having to record the melody chunks one bit at a time, slice them up
in Reaper, and intersperse them between the chugs.
But, I wasn't satisfied with the part being performed this way, even though
it sounded pretty cool, so I decided I had to learn how to play it using
hybrid picking.
In this case memory was fine, i.e., I just kept playing it until I could do it
by feel. My brain couldn't try to keep track of which chug group in the pattern
I was on at any give time.

What is this sort of thing called? It's not really a polymeter or polyrhythm.
It's sort of like a multi-riff--two riffs with non-uniform length segments
woven together.

The "melodic" part is sort of 6 segments then 3 segments.
Each is 1/4 long? And the last is 1/2?

The rhythmic part is 30 x 1/8 notes long?

But the lengths really don't matter. It's the number of sections, and it's the
fact that they aren't all the same length that makes it sound weird
(along with the fact the total number is different.)

So where a polymeter drum part sounds strange because the two drums intersect at
different points in the cycle, it's similar here maybe.

The rhythmic part is like the "meter" or measure of time, but it's nonuniform.
You keep moving through the melodic part one rhythmic unit at a time.
The fact there are a different number of rhythmic units (8) versus melodic
units (9) give it a strange feel.

But yeah, it's really the nonuniform sampling that does it. It's maybe like a
nonuniform time signature?
