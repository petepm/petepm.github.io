As the penultimate tune on [_Synchronized Seasoning_](/music/synchronized-seasoning),
I wanted this one to have a bit of 'tude.
If you've ever wondered what it would be like if a goofy metal guy made
country music, here you go.

[Travis Orbin](http://travisorbin.com) drummed on this tune as one might expect,
and I requested he throw in a little drum solo, which ended up kicking ass,
as you can tell from my subtle (?) commentary throughout.

This tune is now available along with the rest on

YouTube, iTunes, Spotify, Apple Music, etc.


## Composition notes

### Main chuggity chugs

The intro of the tune (after the chromatic-ish pre-intro)
has this kind of chicken-picked hammered-on sort of lick,
which was the first little idea that popped up years and years ago.
I assumed I'd do some sort of heavy palm muting thing with the guitar's
lowest power chord over it,
but left writing the rhythm for that until much later (I think 2020 or so).

So I had to come up with some sort of pattern. I'm not sure how I landed on

    2-1-1-2-2-1-1-4

but after programming it into the scratch drums it seemed to work.


### Chicken lickin' outro

For the outro, I had also come up with a chicken/hybrid picked groups of
two string, four note arpeggios that seemed kind of cool, but lacked a rhythmic
pattern to fit them into. I decided that since I was always punishing Travis with
silly polymeter parts, this time I would instead punish myself and distribute
those arpeggios oddly throughout some other pattern.

In comes the 2-1-1-2-2-1-1-4 chuggity chug pattern to the rescue.
I kept that low power chord pattern part as the backbone,
using a kind of generic "Djent" aesthetic,
but mixed the arpeggios in between.
I ended up having to record the arpeggio chunks one bit at a time, slice them up
in Reaper, and intersperse them between the chugs because my brain could not
work the pattern out otherwise.

Then I had to learn how to play it.
Since I'm not very good at counting things out while playing
(and don't find it to be very fun),
I just kept trying to play along until I could do it by feel, and that worked
nicely.

Is there a name for this sort of thing?
It's not really a polymeter or polyrhythm as far as I can tell.
It's sort of like a poly-riff--two riffs with non-uniform length segments
and different numbers of segments woven together.
The part sounds like it's continuously changing, but isn't hard to follow
after a few listens.
