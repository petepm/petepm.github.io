_Synchronized Seasoning_, released in 2021, but started roughly a decade prior,
and with 6/8 of the tunes published in various levels of completeness along the way,
was quite the project.
A lot happened _in real life_ during that time, and the album is meant to
reflect the cycle of types of thoughts and
emotions incurred therein.

I'm not totally sure if the album fully realized the vision I had for it when I
first started on it, but that's probably the point.
It started off as little inklings of ideas and these all had to be filled in
and fully developed along the way, and it
would have turned out much differently if I had forced myself to finish it all
at once, though that probably would not have been possible.

I hope this album makes you feel some stuff, maybe even something close to
what I was feeling while making it, but if you don't, that's okay.
At least it's done.
