## Spherical lyricals

Destination
Oscillation
Stuck spinning on the wheels
When did this get real

Formation
Impersonation
Kept circling the field
Now slow travel revealed

Kept falling back each step when up again
Time is not some medicine

Felt like the same roads
It was a cycle there
Obscures and hides slow trends
Recurring strife mechanical ends

Heal
Alternating hardened and annealed

Undulations
Constellations
Stuck spinning in the sky
One day they will die

Rotation
Congratulation
Not moving quite the same
Translate to a new frame

Fooled to think this song's parts repeat endlessly
Nothing has eternity

Felt like the same roads
It was a cycle there
Obscures and hides slow trends
Recurring strife mechanical ends

Doom
Easily forgotten in an afternoon

Soon
Another to be left unnoticed waiting in a giant room
Waiting in a giant room

Bounce along a kind of chaotic path
Highs and lows damp out as we grow old
We count all the days we passed the star
Making believe we'll have another turn
So many chances left to learn

Bob up and down now
Joe side to side
Destined to likely be
Another anon (TODO?) cyclic escapee
