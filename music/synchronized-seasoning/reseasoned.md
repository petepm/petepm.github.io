And thus ends [_Synchronized Seasoning_](/music/synchronized-seasoning),
not with a bang or a whimper, but a mostly improvised and very comped guitar solo,
both of which made it damn hard to mimic for the video. Hey, I did my best.

This tune is now available along with the rest on
[bandcamp](https://petepeterson.bandcamp.com/TODO),
YouTube, iTunes, Spotify, Apple Music, etc.


## Composition notes

None really. It's a pretty simple tune with simple chords, though like some of
the others on this album, the string-to-string major 3rd instead of 4th jump is between
the D and G rather than the G and B strings. So basically it's like a 6-string tuned
down to B standard (though a half step down), with an extra higher string.
This means the 1st chord is a typical C shape,
but with the root on the 3rd fret of the E string,
leaving the higher pitch strings open for extending the chords, adding different
flavors and melodic stuff.
