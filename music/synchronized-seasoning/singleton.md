Back when I was 14 years old or so, my cousin and I wrote our first song
together, which was essentially an attempt to sound just like
blink-182's _Enema of the State_. Weezer's blue album had also had a big
influence on us 4 or 5 years prior, but I didn't appreciate _Pinkerton_ until
much later on. Still, those albums stuck with me even as my tastes wandered
more towards the complicated and heavier styles of music.
"Singleton" is basically an amalgam of all that and more with some ska punk
influence added in for a little extra spice.

Note that this song took 7 months to finish, whereas
["Exclusive Orangery"](exclusive-orangery) took 8,
and ["Cliff Walker"](cliff-walker) about 19. Hopefully that acceleration
continues.

My friend, drummer, and fellow weird music creator and enthusiast
[Travis Orbin](http//travisorbin.com) is back yet again bringin' them drums.
I threw a lot on his plate and he nailed it as usual. Be sure to
check out his [session video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLAWeyMi0zM)
to see what a feat the drumming truly was!
Special thanks to Jake Howsam Lowe (The Helix Nebula, Plini, Scoredatura)
and Ro Stevenson (i built the sky) for their feedback on preliminary mixes.

## Lyrics

>If only I could get this stupid song done<br>
>Finally, would be happy<br>
>Uh<br>
>Function with its own rate of change<br>
>Yeah!<br>
>Or complex imaginary
>
>I've slid down<br>
>That slippery slope be-four<br>
>Five-got to kiss<br>
>I will not fail until I fail the next time<br>
>And it's coming back to
>
>This clich√© 'bout quantity of fish in the sea<br>
>Got me<br>
>No arm floaties<br>
>Ow hey<br>
>That old rod bent off awkwardly<br>
>But!<br>
>It's baited masterfully<br>
>
>And the memories assaulting sleep<br>
>And dreams<br>
>The cringe in heaps<br>
>Stacked on my Zs<br>
>They're terrifying me<br>
>Eternally<br>
>
>I always thought that I would miss you<br>
>But now it's in a different way<br>
>Count down the times I would not try<br>
>To fall on my face<br>
>And now it's coming back to you<br>
>
>I see you like your fucking punk songs<br>
>I'd sit and play them all day long<br>
>Then lay all night<br>
>On a pull-out couch<br>
>Sad like a miniature ice cube tray<br>
>I'd say anything to make you feel<br>
>
>No use 'round pretty girls<br>
>Now I'm down on my knees<br>
>Like a nut that fell from a tree<br>
>A fallen seed<br>
>No most won't succeed<br>
>Bumblin' all the way<br>
>Left that sheltered path where some say<br>
>Let's get married<br>
>
>[Whoa hold on now baby]<br>
>[You want to know my password?]<br>
>[I'm just not ready for that kind of commitment]<br>
>
>[Perhaps I can interest you in a guitar solo instead]<br>
>[Oh yeah, just wait until you hear this next part]<br>
>
>Obsession's got you hamstrung<br>
>Treadmill hedonic<br>
>Forget the 's' that's in the front<br>
>Oh I'm creepin' up on ya<br>
>I'm creepin'<br>
>
>I see you like your fucking prog songs<br>
>I'd sit and play them all night long<br>
>Then lay all day next to Lentil Soup<br>
>One evil dragon that I can't slay<br>
>My curse of nothing good to say<br>
>
>I simply shouldn't care<br>
>Be a part of the weird<br>
>Undeclare any air of self<br>
>Awareness it ain't fair<br>
>This Pinkerton pop pulled pork parade<br>
>Struggling all the way<br>
>It must be your last time in love<br>
>So get married
