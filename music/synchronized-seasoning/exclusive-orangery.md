Released into the wild on Valentine's Day 2019,
this song ain't talkin' 'bout love
in a romantic sense,
but a different kind, among other things. Without spoiling the mystery too much,
I will
just say it's about the frustrating correlation between what people think and to
which groups they feel they belong.
Additionally, there are two guitar solos.

As usual, this song is available for consumption via most major music outlets,
e.g., [bandcamp](https://petepeterson.bandcamp.com/track/exclusive-orangery),
Google Play Music, iTunes, Spotify, Apple Music, etc.

## Lyrics

>Please stand<br>
Heavenly father, creator and confirmer of all the facts<br>
Deliver us from the scrolls of false witness<br>
[And sloppy guitar solos]<br>
And grant us unity<br>
Honestly it wouldn't be such a problem<br>
If the other guys weren't so god damned brainwashed<br>
It's like all they do is argue their emotions<br>
Perhaps you can just smite them<br>
Better yet give us permission and we'll take care of it<br>
O holy mighty one, grant us your infinite mercy<br>
We ask this in fights our lord<br>
Amen
>
>Let us pray<br>
That everyone<br>
Not like us will die<br>
You see we've solved<br>
The Mysterious Things<br>

[all rights reserved]<br>
We're better on this side<br>
>
>Veracity<br>
Fenced off locally<br>
We must take steps<br>
To save our souls<br>
From an inflating size of we
>
>Got no uncertainty<br>
They are the enemy<br>
We're to save our world<br>
Hold tight don't let it slip
>
>Breed loyally<br>
Pardoned of the sin<br>
We must preserve<br>
Our pure neighborhood<br>
This evil's leaking in
>
>Got no uncertainty<br>
They are the enemy<br>
We're to save our world<br>
Hold tight don't let it slip
>
>With this identity<br>
Bundle up all beliefs<br>
Weakness hides in shades<br>
No strength from being gray
>
>Please be seated<br>
[Take your seat you little shit]<br>
O almighty and never present lord of common sense<br>
You gave us wisdom so only we can see the truth<br>
There's no need for a world beyond the fence
>
>Mmm you're down in Hell bitch<br>
Bet you wish you weren't such a six-fold symmetric feathery ice crystal<br>
Down here<br>
Heh
>
>Don't need to be right<br>
As long as we stand<br>
Tall, strong, sure<br>
They will lose the fight
>
>Know why yous got sent down to Hell<br>
Think about it<br>
Your lack of participation<br>
In our family of validation<br>
No dedication<br>
No loyalty to your nation
>
>Took millions of years<br>
To figure out how to identify and exclude harmful individuals from groups<br>
You think we could just ditch this evolutionary baggage<br>
It's not baggage<br>
It's luggage
>
>[I loved thee]
>
>Callout
>
>[As long as you continued to reflect me]
>
>No need to be right<br>
As long as we stand<br>
Tall, strong, pure<br>
They deserve their plight
>
>[Down in hell again]<br>
[Burn baby burn]<br>
[Speak about the evil when we see them]
>
>Fallout
>
>[Peace]<br>
[You know we can win gimme money]
>
>There is no right<br>
Just messaging<br>
Good!
>
>Praised be mighty individualists<br>
Dominating all<br>
Must be brave<br>
Pronounce our holy days<br>
Our kind shall never fall<br>
[We're the only ones left with balls]<br>
>
>From this little bubble<br>
We can't see the rubble<br>
One small price to pay
>
>Still no uncertainty<br>
Still need an enemy<br>
We're to save our world<br>
Hold tight don't let it slip
>
>With this identity<br>
Bundle up all beliefs<br>
Weakness hides in shades<br>
No strength from being gray
>
>If with them you're running<br>
Your shit isn't funny<br>
Show the team you're made<br>
Of virtuous DNA
>
>We the better species<br>
They can rest in pieces<br>
See the truth the way<br>
Just us will be okay
