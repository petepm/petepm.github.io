Art, entertainment, cultural cohesion, cutting rugs,
radical prehistoric themes, sex, drugs, and wannabe jazz;
the third track from
from [_Synchronized Seasoning_](/music/synchronized-seasoning),
"Cliff Walker" has it all.
It's obviously a bit of a sequel to
["Cliff Driver"](/music/songs-these-are-songs/cliff-driver),
but from a different (perhaps more mature) perspective.

As usual, this song is available for consumption via most major music outlets,
including:

* [bandcamp](https://petepeterson.bandcamp.com/track/cliff-walker)
* Google Play Music
* iTunes
* Spotify
* Apple Music
* etc.

## Drumbin'

My good pal and go-to session drumberista
[Travis Orbin](http://travisorbin.com)
politely insisted on playing on this tune after hearing some of the licks on
[Instagram](https://instagram.com/petepppeterson).
Since he kicks ass,
and programming these drums properly was going to be a huge pain in the ass,
I happily agreed.
However, I wanted to try a different process with this one,
so instead of sending him
a scratch track with my own programmed drums from the start,
I sent over just the guitars, piano, and click,
so he could come up with parts without being influenced by mine.

I was hoping we could ultimately record drums on the fly without writing them out note-for-note,
maybe even playing together in the same room (gasp!),
but there wasn't enough time for that.
I sent over my drum parts a couple days after the initial scratch tracks,
then ten days after that Travis sent me back some MIDI for his parts.
Two months and a few dozen emails later, we were good to go.
As usual, it was way worth it to hire the guy,
since he wrote and played some amazing and creative stuff!

## Lyrics

>Walk into this dirty cave<br>
[Hey there pal how are ya]<br>
No idea how to behave
>
Hey 'bout that moon<br>
Me confused<br>
Let us relate<br>
'Bout our post-cretaceous state
>
Smilodon caught my tongue<br>
Rubble rabble rumbles<br>
You ain't gonna make no young
>
Ooo slightly blue<br>
Haven't been chased by a lion for a day or two<br>
Sip on something new<br>
This fluid makes ya super cool it's true<br>
No son<br>
If you can't decode how to be fun<br>
You'll be no one
>
We survived 'til Friday night<br>
It's the end of the week [the weak?]<br>
Spent the whole thing cold and rolling stones<br>
Doin' caveman things
>
Bouncin' 'round some burnin' thing<br>
To get along<br>
Periodically<br>
That matchin' motion<br>
Sticks on skin and magic potion<br>
Like tomorrow won't be
>
With the weight of the world<br>
Coming down<br>
We're growin' up<br>
Absolutely freaked<br>
Complete expressive bits<br>
It's not so tough
>
Acting out our biggest fear<br>
Up there on stage<br>
Syncin' up our feels<br>
Disguised and slime<br>
They sell the sighs<br>
Say sign here take over the world<br>
It's destiny<br>
Let's get real
>
Snakes old take hold<br>
Make all fake gold<br>
Whiner...
>
Schweinefleisch<br>
Get down<br>
Get down<br>
Don't be so damn strange yeah
>
Just dance<br>
You've been enhanced<br>
Don't need no plan<br>
It's in the can<br>
Gotta show your symmetry<br>
Walk and talk like you are the man<br>
See a shakin' ass<br>
What to do?<br>
Y'all came prepared<br>
You just scared<br>
Make that mistake say you're kiddin' though
>
Snazzy dudes, snazzy dudes<br>
Snazzy dudes live in a can<br>
Snazzy dudes live in a can now fuck yeah
>
Fantasy in prehistory<br>
Just hang a while and you will see<br>
It's me<br>
Stuck awkwardly<br>
Full three STDs from the mean<br>
No moves<br>
Ain't smooth<br>
Make sounds<br>
How 'bout a groove<br>
Got to prove<br>
That I got a role<br>
That I got a soul<br>
Check it<br>
Check it<br>
Check<br>
Hey<br>
Check it out now
>
All on their feet<br>
Hypnotized by the beat<br>
It's the sounds<br>
Cast the spell<br>
And you'd think that it's cheatin'
>
Wow an excuse<br>
Not to train this caboose<br>
These emos<br>
Sewn to ears<br>
Signal takes on<br>
Some strange control
>
There's plenty deep enough to find<br>
Stop your whining damn fool<br>
It's out there<br>
Think you're too cool
>
Waking dead on Sunday morn<br>
It's wasted time again<br>
Have to admit that for the slick tricks I ain't fit<br>
I cannot pretend
>
Got into a funked up place out there alone<br>
Total should been tea<br>
When art and stuff ain't quite enough<br>
Desperation becomes decoration<br>
[shunned] by the tribe but it's fine<br>
That's the deal<br>
Invent the wheel
