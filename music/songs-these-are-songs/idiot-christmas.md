This "song" is a combination of ridiculosity and my own ignorance/confusion
regarding economics, more specifically the finance "industry." The recording
features Travis Orbin's metronome... along with his fine drumming, hehe. The
drums were recorded at Taylor Larson's studio in Bethesda, MD.


## Lyrics

>â€˜Tis the appropriate season to recount the tale<br>
Of a quaint polar workshop that was too big to ummmm, fail<br>
Some warned it was likely the boom was a bubble<br>
But no one could pinpoint the cause of the trouble
>
Hey, the north pole's economy<br>
Has been hijacked quite financially<br>
At the reins are snowmen creditors with sole responsibility<br>
Killing fiscally
>
While pretending it would not happen at all<br>
The price of gingerbread it then instead begins to fall<br>
Santa needs those snowmen and agrees<br>
It must be regulation that's been spreading this disease
>
Those hard working elves<br>
Working by themselves<br>
Making less, working more<br>
It's the old class war<br>
Not fair not fair it's so not fair
>
It isn't impossible to get your tokens for free<br>
Collecting the compounding interest perpetually<br>
Predicting the downfall of others an option to make one so rich<br>
If you're the loser well sorry your life's such a bitch
>
Investment is useful for finding efficiency<br>
Among the ones who put wealth in effectively<br>
But when the tokens are made only virtually<br>
Things just turn to shit!
>
Oh yeah they speculate!<br>
Attempting to reap the rewards of the things they did not help create<br>
But when there's no memory where it came<br>
It makes it so hard to determine if the price and value are the same
>
But these guys were to see their plans<br>
Head straight for a clash with reality<br>
True, wind mills and stagecoaches run on sunshine but<br>
Some how how how how need to be cared for diligently
>
Here comes old Santa to rescue the ones that were wrong<br>
So they could go back to the schemes that they pulled all along<br>
He changed up the game so if you risk and fail<br>
You will not need to suffer 'cause out you'll be bailed!<br>
And meanwhile the elves are just keeping afloat and trying to capture some wind in the sails<br>
The system relies on the fact that no one out there can figure out what this really entails<br>
Besides that won't impress females
