"Bugz" is somewhat of a ripoff/combination of Mr. Bungle, Meshuggah, and maybe
some Dillinger Escape Plan. It also happens to be my first tune with Travis
Orbin on drums. It's got a mildly lame story line to it and some
numerically-driven parts, which may either come off as interesting or contrived,
but hey, it's better than random noise, right?

Note: The explanations below are for the "top level" conceptual design
of the rhythms and drum parts. Smaller timescale/finer-detailed events were
"filled in" by Travis down to the very last note. You can download his
transcription [here](http://www.travisorbin.com/images/PetePeterson-Bugz.JPG).


## Somewhat interesting partz

### The Int-Bro (0:00-0:28)

The time intervals between each guitar note accent are picked from the first 20 digits of the number _e_. This choice makes some sense since _e_ is a part of exponential growth functions, which are relevant to the lyrics. The digits/durations are 2, 7, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 8, 4, 5, 9, 0, 4, 5, 2, 3, 5 with the "0" interval being almost a flam. Amazingly, Travis pulled his part off flawlessly in the studio (strictly as he had charted no less), which is extra impressive since there's really no recurring pattern... it's irrational!


### The 11 Blooz (1:34-2:00)

Most of this part turned out to be in some 11 time with the hi-hat playing 3. This was an artifact of programming the scratch drums as a matter of fact. It's sort of fun to switch between keeping track of the hats versus the guitar riff.


### The Orbitz of the Spheres (2:08-2:43)

The rhythmic patterns here are loosely based on various orbital and rotational periods of planets in our solar system. Earth's orbit is represented by the snare pattern repeating every 8 8th notes (8/8 = 1). The snare hits twice every other time to approximately represent Mars, whose year is almost two Earth years long. The repeating 3-note pattern on the hi-hat lasts two 8th notes, since Mercury's orbital period is roughly 1/4 that of Earth. Venus' "rhythm" has a 10 beat period with various permutations of a 2, 4, 3 pattern (its rotational period is ~243 Earth days) on the kick drum punctuated by a china hit.


### The Bugz Gang (2:56-3:32)

This part came from the lyrics in a way. The "Bugs, we are bugs; bugs is what we are!" came out randomly in a conversation with my little brothers. We thought it was a funny thing to say so I decided it should go in a song. Since this is a 7 note pattern it was slapped over 4 and each cycle the notes (or words) shift forward 1/7 of a cycle, where words circulate back to the beginning after reaching the end. The instrumental part right before this one has the same pattern just twice as fast.

We don’t live that long anyway
