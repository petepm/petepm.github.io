This little ditty, originally recorded in 2009, was supposed to be on a compilation album, which fell through, so it was released as a single, then re-released on [_Songs, These Are Songs_](https://petepetersonmusic.com/music/songs-these-are-songs/). The drums and the piano are programmed but the "percussion" is real!

## Lyrics

>What was the mistake that brought me back here?<br>
I'm feeling like I'm running out of air<br>
A voluntary torturous affair<br>
I'm floating in this poison to become unaware
>
Focused negativity<br>
Can clear this sphere of confusion surrounding me<br>
Long have I gone with nobody catching my drift<br>
I'm driving off of a cliff
>
This commodity<br>
So many locks but never the proper key<br>
Lost in my mind I'll sit here and wait for the shift<br>
I'm driving off of a cliff
>
Got to slide<br>
Back inside<br>
Why go through this ritual when we are only trying to fuck?
>
Don't be shy<br>
Make that face and sell it<br>
Drive away<br>
Building layers of some
>
Insulation<br>
Just get me my guitar and I'll play myself a solo just for fun
>
I'm trying to evolve my own amusement<br>
Ears won't stop ringing from all the cover bands singing<br>
Feel like a drone
>
Ooh, ooh yeah I just don't fit in anywhere<br>
It's getting hard to defend<br>
And I don't think that I can train myself to care
>
I'm driving away, driving away<br>
I'm done with wasting my hearing if you got nothin' to say<br>
I'm driving away<br>
I'm leaving tonight in the rain<br>
It takes its toll on my so-called soul<br>
It's driving me insane
>
It kills me to be happy<br>
No productivity<br>
So unhip, just want to quit<br>
Done with this industry
>
Done with mistakes that will lead here<br>
Getting out and getting fresh air<br>
Waking up from this nightmare<br>
Driving off a cliff!<br>
Focusing, become aware<br>
Driving up a giant fucking cliff, yeah!
