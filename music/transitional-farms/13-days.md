This tune was written and mostly recorded in 2009, right before I moved away
from the town I'd lived in since I was two years old, along with just about
everyone I knew (boohoo what a sentimental wimp). In fact, I wrote most of the
lyrics and recorded most of the vocals roughly thirteen days after I had moved.
It just sort of worked out that way I guess. Miracles bro.

The main guitar parts are all chords arpeggiated in various sequences of
thirteen notes. For example, the first sequence is (from lowest note to highest,
without regard for scale degree or anything like that): 1-2-3, 1-2-3-4,
1-2-3-4-5-6. The second is: 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4-5. The third is: 1-2-3,
1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3-4. The total number of digits is 13 for each one! Miracles
bro.

The hi-hat accent pattern during the chorus is sort of a natural result of drum
programming. It's very easy to mindlessly copy and paste a 4 note pattern over
the 13 note pattern when programming in the key roll. Similar to the “blooz”
part in “Bugz”, it's interesting to try to keep track of the accent and where it
lands with respect to the thirteen note sequence. Miracles bro.

Like the rest of the songs on _Transitional Farms_, [Travis
Orbin](http://youtube.com/shaftninja) is on the ol' drum set being a pretty cool
guy. Miracles bro.


## Lyrics

>Time to go to bed
Time to go to sleep
Dreams that lie ahead
Won’t be your relief
One foot in this world
The spiral makes another swirl
>
Wrote down all you said
Counted all your sheep
Packed up all your things
Things you’ll need to keep
Soon you’re surely see
It costs a lot just to be free
>
I won’t miss you
In other words
Our paths will cross someday
I will find your way
>
Questioning the best
What’s inside the chest
Seems eternally
Like we’ll never be
Gone for thirteen days
And drifting slowly out of phase
>
Questioning your strength
Is it well-received?
Time projects a length
Harder to perceive
Is this even relevant now?
>
I have been in bed
I have been asleep
Longer than I ought
Time to be complete
So complete
