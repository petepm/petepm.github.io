Track two from _Transitional Farms_, "Death Country", is essentially one big
rant with some possibly disingenuous optimism thrown in for good measure. When
the lyrics were written, Sarah Palin had just become the center of attention in
US politics, which was an interesting time for sure.

This tune features the fearless Travis Orbin on drums, replacing the original
programmed ones. He ended up changing quite a few things for the better,
including a “gravity blast” beat, which happens to start at the 666th beat of
the song. Check out his session video on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG6f_aEnGic). The "1-2-3-4-5-6" vocal
lead in is a continuation of the end of "Touring Kuntucky", since 6 is the next
number descending Pascal's Triangle. Actually, this was partly an
afterthought/coincidence.


## Lyrics

>Welcome to a world where everyone knows everything<br>
And every stupid motherfucking asshole's got to take a stand on anything<br>
Without a doubt<br>
Help me now<br>
Dancin' while I scream and shout<br>
Assumin' things are boomin' but we're headed straight for doom and I'm just sittin' in my room and wishin' that I wasn't human<br>
>
Hey, that's right kids<br>
Buy more shit<br>
You'll just have to get used to it<br>
You don't have an excuse for it<br>
Thinkin' is a great big waste of your time<br>
Ignorance will lead you to peace of mind
>
Yeah, we'll see the day<br>
Leavin' light outside the window<br>
We'll see the day it'll open up<br>
And sun begins to shine
>
If you're bright they'll try to scoop you up to make the sights<br>
Your less gifted peers will surely need to fight<br>
Uranium 235 will help our dogma to survive<br>
We've got a flag it's called a rag for which you die<br>
Now, let's go folks<br>
Watch more sports<br>
You don't have enough space for it<br>
You'll acquire a taste for it<br>
Mathematics helps count your wasted time<br>
Astrology will say nothing but your sign
>
Say, what's that there?<br>
Rocks that shine<br>
You don't wanna get trapped by it<br>
Rather get bitch slapped by it<br>
Drivin' all the compassion from my mind<br>
Do us all a big favor and resign
