_Transitional Farms_, released in 2011, is a ~4.2 song EP-type-thing; and with the exception of “Touring Kuntucky...”, was mostly recorded in 2008-2009. In November 2010, the always-incredible Travis Orbin was hired to record live drums to replace the original programmed drums. Check out Travis' [YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/shaftninja) for high quality drum session videos. _Transitional Farms_ is available for download from most online music stores, including [bandcamp](http://petepeterson.bandcamp.com/album/transitional-farms), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/music/album/Pete_Peterson_Transitional_Farms?id=Bfk64v3pi5lz3ycgplzrybilhsu&feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImFsYnVtLUJmazY0djNwaTVsejN5Y2dwbHpyeWJpbGhzdSJd), and [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/transitional-farms/id450785554).
