This tune, the third track from "Transitional Farms", was also written and
mostly recorded in 2009, with Travis Orbin's more recent drumming superimposed
for the 2011 release. It's inspired by Jonathan Swift's light and misanthropic
tale of adventure, "Gulliver's Travels", which is also a good movie (the one
with Ted Danson, not Jack Black).


## Fun facts

The main chord progression in the song is a series of simple two note chords
made from the same six notes, all part of the major scale. It's fun to play when
simultaneously weaving in the little melody (also made up of notes from the
major scale). It's also interesting to look at how the notes in the chords are
related to each other with respect to the key and what intervals they create
with respect to the roots of the chords themselves.

| Notes | Scale positions | Intervals |

|  F+C  | 1+5             | F(1st in key) and its 5th |
| E+C | 7+5 | E(7th in key) and its minor 6th |
| G+Bb | 2+4 | G(2nd in key) and its minor 3rd |
| F+A | 1+3 | F(1st in key) and its major 3rd |
| G+A | 3+2  | A(3rd in key) and its inverted minor 7th |
| G+Bb | 4+2 | Bb(4th in key) and its inverted 6th |
| E+Bb | 7+4 | E(7th in key) and its diminished 5 |
| F+C | 1+5 | Back to the tonic power chord again. “Tension” resolved! |


## Lyrics

>Hard to see I'm just staring at a gray sky<br>
I've been gone for years and many hoped I'd died<br>
Seen some things that I will never see again<br>
Will you remember me the way that I was then?
>
Find my body washed up on a new and strange shore<br>
Tiny men they're fighting in their tiny war<br>
Can't relate and I'm not welcome anymore<br>
On my own still searching yet don't know what for
>
Fall into a higher level<br>
Mixing things that could be special<br>
Then my plan blows right up in my face<br>
We are sorry you must leave this place<br>
Even though you don't take up much space
>
No! They stared into the sun<br>
They said their world is done<br>
Intelligent conversation in one direction<br>
End of the world<br>
Ball
>
I! Have got to find my way<br>
Perfection still gets old<br>
Try but they just won't get the message<br>
I'm out into the cold
>
Hey man! We are the mighty Strolbrogs!<br>
We kill everything!<br>
Taste what immortality brings!
>
Horsies, yahoos, mental, health<br>
I am only gonna hurt you baby I suggest you give me some time and gimme space
>
Lost, alone, far from home<br>
Things I've seen, you won't believe<br>
Leave? We just can't let you leave now<br>
I have grown to the stars<br>
Things I've shown won't go far
>
Babe, I sure miss you<br>
And I assure that you can be sure every single thing that I have told to you it true<br>
Wow!
>
You're losing with me<br>
The possibility to reconcile with all that's shallow and vile embedded in society<br>
I've got perspective between myself and thee<br>
Just stay one of another kind of sort of on the cover of a page of a script<br>
Thoughts are adrift<br>
Give you a lift<br>
Drive off a cliff
