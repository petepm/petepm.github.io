This tune was conceived as a little hokey intro for "Death Country". Most of the
lyrics and main chord progression were written around 2007, back when I was in
my previous band. Traverse Obrin is on this track drumming, stomping, and
clapping his way into your heart after the barn dance. You must check out his
[session
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=LibEZSU_134), as
it is the most complicated drumming he has ever done. The ending has a little
numerical pattern you might recognize from high school algebra class. Also, the
phrase "fun, fun, fun, fun" was recorded before Rebecca Black hit the scene so
that isn't plagiarism.


## Lyrics

>Pressure fluctuating but it's only time that creates things in here<br>
Mystic hexagrams from conic sections<br>
Cycloid quadrature, my own selection<br>
That matrix exponential thing<br>
Those patterns Fibonacci brings
>
Simplifying fluid from Torricelli<br>
Coefficients turn to geometry<br>
The cosmic wager on your own<br>
It's something we have never known<br>
And I'm just having too much fun fun fun fun<br>
The zeroth row is only<br>
one<br>
one one<br>
one one-two one<br>
one one-two-three one-two-three one<br>
one one-two-three-four...
