  Pete Peterson prompts pals for potential percussive parts:
  Can humans create better drums than AI?
---

In case you haven't noticed,
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is all the rage these days,
and quite a few Internet Musicians are helping to advertise products like
Suno, which uses AI to generate music.

I have no interest in listening to AI generated music,
since I like humans.
This may be surprising, but it's true.
One of the great things about music is that it's made by humans.
You get to know someone through their music.
You build a kind of relationship with the artist,
other listeners, etc.

But it seems like the industry is going that way.
When you treat music as a product, and some technology allows you to create
that product more cheaply, it's going to get used.

However, I wanted to do an experiment to see how good AI can do with
more unconventional music.
See, these models are trained to produce the most likely output,
which you could think of as the most generic, average, etc.
I personally believe composers and musicians should be creating new
and unique things.

I also wanted to pit AI against humans to see how it goes.
In this case,
I wrote a short tune and will send it off to a few session drummers
with no drums on it at all.
I also wanted to open it up to anyone else to try their hand at composing
and/or recording drums.
If they're cool enough to use in a release,
I'll give you $100 for MIDI and $200 for nicely recorded audio.

There's only one constraint on the drums at the very end,
and that's there because it will flow into the next tune.

The deadline for submission is roughly March 31st, 2026.
The audio and "prompt" are in sections below.
You can email entries to pete.peterson.music@gmail.com with the subject:
"Human vs AI drums".
Good luck, humans!

## The audio

You can download a WAV file of the guitars and piano TODO.

## The prompt

Create some fun and exciting drums for this prog-metal song with
some honky tonk vibes.

Here are some descriptions for how I imagine each part should sound,
along with tempos and timestamps:

| Time range | Tempo (BPM) | Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|------|-------------|
| 00:00–00:02 | 100 | Count-in    | Nothing here. |
| 00:02–00:18 | 100 | Intro | This part reminds me of a mix of Plini and The Faceless. It should feel powerful. |
| 00:18–00:21 | 100 | Chicken honk | Old-timey country bluegrass feel. Drums should not be overpowering here. It's not a heavy part. |
| 00:21–00:28 | 100 | Intro more | Back to heavy, powerful, toms, snare, crashes. |
| 00:28–00:30 | 100 | Chicken tonk | Back to old-timey country whatever. |
| 00:30–00:35 | 100 | Intro more redux | Back to powerful. Come in swinging with snares and crashes. |
| 00:35–00:38 | 150 | Country beetles | Tempo actually switches at 00:32.7. I feel something like a train beat but with some ride bell. |
