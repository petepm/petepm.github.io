Quite a while ago, Travis reached out and asked if I'd contribute
a guitar solo for his album "Silly String III", and here's the result.
Apparently the song was composed using the Persian scale,
which I had never heard of,
but was a nice place to start.
Of course a bunch of pentatonic and chromatic licks snuck in there
since I composed the solo by just playing with the track over and
over again. I hope you dig it, and suggest you go buy the
[album](https://travisorbin.bandcamp.com/album/silly-string-iii)!
