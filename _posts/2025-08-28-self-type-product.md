Here's another tune I call "Self Type Product", or "STP" for short.
It will likely end up as track 7 on [_Greyleaf_](/music/greyleaf/index.md),
and will also probably have real drums for the full album version.

The song is about how social media is bad,
and if I were smart,
I'd quit
[like Carl King](https://carlkingdom.com/carl-king-is-no-longer-on-social-media).
