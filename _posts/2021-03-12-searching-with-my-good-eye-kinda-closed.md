This tune from Soundgarden's _Badmotorfinger_ is one of my favorites so I thought I'd record my interpretation, up through the first chorus at least.
It's transposed down to play on a 7-string and the intro key is sort of rationalized with the rest of the song, partly for the mechanics of playing on a 7-string, and partly because it sounds more natural to me.
