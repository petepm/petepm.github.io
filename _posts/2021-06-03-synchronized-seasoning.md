Hey, after like a decade the [album](/music/synchronized-seasoning) is finally out,
and with it two fresh tunes,
["Rockwell C"](/music/synchronized-seasoning/rockwell) and
["Reseasoned (The Cyclic)"](/music/synchronized-seasoning/reseasoned).

All the rest were
remixed, remastered, and with any programmed drums (and samples) replaced by
much cooler and badasser real drums.
Take a listen on
[bandcamp](https://petepeterson.bandcamp.com/album/synchronized-seasoning),
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/2eewWORVBHs),
or anywhere else you like to consume musics.
