Here's a little video clip documenting some of the writing process for "Singleton"
from [_Synchronized Seasoning_](/music/synchronized-seasoning).
The latter half shows the development of a new chord---the "heartbeat chord"---based on real ECG data.
It sounds terrible, but it serves to encode more information into a song that
will be at least partially about relationship type stuff,
or "matters of the heart." Hopefully it isn't too ridiculous.
