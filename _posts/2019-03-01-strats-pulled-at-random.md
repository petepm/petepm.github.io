title: Strats Pulled at Random

I love the sound of Strat and Tele neck pickups. The single coil tucked way up
where the 24th fret would be produces such a glorious tone,
which is unfortunately rare in today's metal music.

When I first got my Agile Sentinel 7-string Strat way back in 2010 or something,
I immediately started playing stuff that sort of sounded like Rage Against the
Machine and Soundgarden.
I then started toying around with the idea of covering Meshuggah's
"Straws Pulled at Random" since it struck me how
such a moving rhythm can take on a different
character with a different guitar tone.
It took a few years, and I only recorded
the end section, but here we are.

This is somewhat of a preview for some of the aesthetics I hope to achieve with
the 6th track on [_Synchronized Seasoning_](/music/synchronized-seasoning),
i.e., a 22-fret single coil neck pickup tuned to drop-G#, not palm-muted.
That tune should be out before the end of the decade.
