I recently had a little adventure out in California, visiting my brother in
San Francisco, then riding with him down to San Jose to see the Cirque du Soleil
Volta show my sister works for. After that I headed off on my own down to LA.
The video above has some footage from the ride, and ends with a rundown of the
gear I took along.
